## Getting Started (Run Locally)

This project makes use of **ReactJS** and **Node** for the frontend, with **Flask**, **PostgreSQL** and **SQLAlchemy** for the backend. Include any other crucial tool used in this project. To be able to run this project locally, all the aforementioned tools have to be set up properly.

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask application. You would need to set up your environment and some environment variables to run the application successfully.

[Find the steps to set up the backend server locally in the backend's README](./backend/README.md).

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a completed ReactJS web application that consumes the data from the Flask server. You would also need to set up some environment variables to run the frontend application successfully.

[Find the steps to set up the front-end web application locally in the front-end's README](./frontend/README.md)/
